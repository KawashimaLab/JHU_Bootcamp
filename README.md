# JHU_Bootcamp

This is a github repository for the JHU bootcamp class hosted by Ahrens lab on August 21st, 2017 in HHMI Janelia. 
Tutors: Mika Rubinov and Takashi Kawashima

The goal of this class is to learn the basics of data analysis for large-scale calcium imaging experiments. In our experiment, calcium activities of ~100,000 neurons are simuntaneously recorded in the brain of larval zebrafish, which is behaving in a virtual reality environment[ref 1,2]. 



In this class, we use Matlab as a programming environment. The imaging dataset is deposited in thd dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n6f2y69s3l985bp/AADXv21TYRkZJI5U2AnAbFP5a?dl=0. In this experiment, the fish changes its swimming pattern in response to various visual stimuli presented in the environment. We will analyze the l neurons encode swimming pattern, incoming visual stimuli
